# What is Chirpy?

Why not start this blog of with a post about the stack used for it? Chirpy is a theme for Jekyll, a static site generator. It easily runs from Github Pages completely for free. It's available as a template [here](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) and requires minimal configuration.
I considered using other solutions, however, this appears to be perfect for what I want it to do - Just a simple, good looking blog that doesn't require a lot of maintenace to keep running.

# How it works.

It's very simple! Once you've configured the site, you just write markdown files in the _post folder. Every time you edit the repository, a Github Action will run to process and update the website with the new post.
